Jive Development Daily Stand Up Tool

This project contains code for a simple tool that shows the daily standup schedule for each of our development teams.  The tool shows the current system time (as measured at the "server" where the app is deployed) and the amount of time remaining in each team's standup session.  The schedule auto-magically rolls over as time progresses and each team (hopefully) completes their respective standup session.

You can kind of think of this app as similar to an egg timer on mini-steroids.
